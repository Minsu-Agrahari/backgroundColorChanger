# Background Color Changer 🎨

This is a simple web project that lets users change the background color of the webpage by clicking on colored buttons.

## 🚀 Features

- Clickable color buttons (grey, white, blue, yellow, orange)
- Dynamically changes the background color using JavaScript
- Minimal and clean HTML/CSS structure
- Beginner-friendly DOM manipulation example

## 📁 Project Structure

backgroundColorChanger/

├── index.html

├── style.css

└── script.js


## 🧠 How It Works

- The HTML file contains clickable `<span>` elements styled as buttons.
- When a user clicks a button, JavaScript captures the event and changes the background color based on the `id` of the clicked element.

## 💡 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Minsu-Agrahari/backgroundColorChanger.git
```

2. Open the index.html file in your browser.
